I am a physicist, working in optical instrumentation and a photographer in my spare time.

Currently, I'm a <b>Master's student in Physics</b> at [University of São Paulo](www2.ifsc.usp.br/portal-ifsc/), where I graduated in Physics with a minor in Optics and Photonics (2019-2022). My research relies on laser development, emphasizing in high-repetition solid-state femtosecond lasers at [Optics and Photonics Research Center (CEPOF)](https://www.ifsc.usp.br/cepof/en/).

I'm part of the organization of the [Integrated Week of the São Carlos Institute of Physics - SIFSC](https://sifsc.ifsc.usp.br/), participate in the [USP IFSC OPTICA Student Chapter](https://www.instagram.com/usp_ifsc_optica_chapter/) and of the [IFSC-USP SPIE Chapter](https://www.instagram.com/spiechapterusp/).

I have a keen interest in optical instrumentation research spanning  diverse applications, ranging from imaging to optical analysis, as well  as in the development and application of femtosecond lasers for studies in nonlinear optics, laser-tissue interactions, and  micromachining. I also possess photography expertise, encompassing both digital and analog photography, and covering a wide spectrum of subjects, including artistic photography and documenting physics experiments.
