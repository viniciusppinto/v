  abstract={The Elitzur-Vaidman bomb testing problem is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics that explores the concepts of quantum superposition and entanglement. The problem creates a scenario where a bomb is activated by absorbing a single photon and suggests testing that it works without exploding it, so that classically it is impossible to know if the bomb works without disturbing the system. Therefore, an interferometer with two arms and two outputs is proposed, mounted in such a way that only one of them has positive interference. However, when placing a pump that works in one of the arms, the interference pattern breaks down, and it can be inferred that the pump works without interacting with it. In this work, a methodology is adopted that combines computational simulations and a simple experimental proposal to investigate the concept of Interaction-Free Measurements. The IBM quantum cloud programming language (Qiskit Runtime) is utilized to simulate the experiments, and an experimental approach is proposed that uses simple laser sources to qualitatively test the theory, offering a practical perspective for developing an understanding of quantum concepts.},

  title = {Brewed coffee quality: a novel perspective based on the chemometrics of sensory attributes},
  abstract = {Coffee is consumed by 98% of Brazilian and is considered the second most consumed beverage in the world and one of the most traded on the stock exchange. Brazil is one of the most important coffee producers, both in terms of consumption and exportation of the processed raw bean. There is complexity in the production chain as consumers look, for beverages that evoke memories and good feelings while enjoying a cup of coffee. The facts is, for the maintenance and standardization of the blends sold the SCAA protocol method, which assesses 11 qualitative and quantitative coffee requirements, generating a score. The higher the score, the better the coffee is considered. In this study, we present a statistical correlation analysis of variables that demonstrates that five requirements directly impact the final score of the coffee: aroma, balance, acidity, flavor, body, and sweetness, the latter being presented as neutral requirement. Another statistical analysis conducted compares the samples based on their origin. It was found that coffees from each country exhibit statistically significant variances, meaning that the overall score of the product differs noticeably depending on its structure. Lastly, it was understood that the Brazilian consumer prioritizes aroma as the main quality factor, whereas specialists consider it the fourth most important aspect in professional evaluations.},
